# Weighted-Bayesian-Linear-Regression-WBLR-Unknown-Variance
A tiny-but-complete Python implementation of **Weighted Bayesian Linear Regression** when the observation noise variance is **unknown** and endowed with an Inverse-Gamma prior.   Analytical posterior updates and Student-t predictive distributions are provided for both single-output and multi-output cases.
